# j-notation [![CI Status][ci-status-badge]][ci-status] [![Documentation][docs-badge]][docs]

An exploration into an alternate surface syntax. To use, run `raco pkg install --auto j-notation`,
then start your programs with `#lang j-notation`. The language doesn't do anything yet, but it will
parse your code and print out the parse tree. See the `examples/` directory for inspiration.
